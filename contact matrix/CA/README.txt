cleaned contact layers, note contacts here should be interpreted as effective contacts. We set the expected number of contacts in the community and school layer in line with estimates generated in Mistry et. al 2021: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20544-y#Sec7:~:text=Human%2Dmixing%20patterns%20for,each%20setting%20k. 


In the community layer, we assume 2.79 effective contacts. 
In the school layer, we assume 11.41 effective contacts.
Household contacts are based on empirical data.
